Domain knowledge:
I have worked on ERP, broadcasting and healthcare domain in my career but majorly from last 4 years i am working on healthcare domain itself.
Here in my current company I am working on EHR - Electronic Health Records project which is a fundamental part of our healthcare IT efforts. 
It involves developing and maintaining the central software system that stores and manages patient medical records, treatment plans, clinical notes, and other essential healthcare information. 
This system is crucial for healthcare providers as it enables them to efficiently access, update, and share patient data, leading to improved patient care coordination, streamlined workflows, and better-informed medical decisions. 
Our team plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability, security, and functionality of this Core-EHR system to support the delivery of high-quality healthcare services.

Coming to linux:
I had worked on linux when i was working on compatability testing in my 1st company and have a good handson the basic and important linux commands like
cat command
ls command
pwd command
grep command
fgrep command
egrep command
rm, -r command
directory commands like: mkdir, move commands like mv etc and i am constantly working on linux whenevr time permits as its open source and light weight i feel this may be very handy skill for a test engineer to add to his/her skillset

BDD testing knowledge:
I know the workflow of how BDD works and what is the difference between BDD and traditional approach how BDD may be benificial and for the same reason company are moving towards the BDD approach to bridge the gap between the bussiness teams and the techincal team and I am aware of the Gherkins language and different command like GIVEN, WHEN, AND, THEN
I am aware of different phases involved in BDD approach like 
Discovery phase
Firmualtion Phase and
Automation phase

And as of now I have not practically worked on cucmber but i have started a course online to learn and practically implement it. I would be able to desgin a framework in cuckmber from scratch as soon as i learn and i hope it would take me around 1 month to learn the concepts as i am a quick learner.
